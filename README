I have always admired the code Peter Norvig writes. But reading code gives only
a superficial understanding. To really understand the code one must work with it.
Since I was learning ES6 I decided to reimplement all the code in pytudes in ES6.
My goal is to write the most idiomatic ES6 without worrying about the performance.

To get started run

```
npm install
```
